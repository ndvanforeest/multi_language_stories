# Parallel texts in multiple languages


This repo contains English stories translated to (currently) Dutch and Turkish. The structure is like this.

The source_files directory contains the source files. Each source file contains one story. A file consists of sets of lines, separated by ampersands (&), the first line of a set is Dutch, the second English, the third is Turkish. The last line of a set ends with a double slash (\\\\).

The python file `make_docs.py` processes the source files into latex files, that in turn are processed (by a call to  `pdf_latex') into pdf files.

The pdf files speak for themselves, I guess.

In case you like to add a language, or otherwise contribute to this project let me know. The idea is to take the English stories as leading, and translate those stories to a target language, in my case Dutch. The sentences in the target language should be 1) simple and (very important) natural, and once this is ensured, 2) try to stay as close as possible to the English source. It is evident that,  in general, it is impossible to translate the English in a one-to-one way to a target language. Hence, (once more), the most important criterion to meet is that the sentences in the target language are simple and natural (from a native's point of view.) Like this a learner of the target language gets a feeling for the language as used by natives.

If you plan to help add a language, please mind the structure of the source files. They are input into latex files, so the formatting is crucial.

An interesting extension would be to read the stories (by a native) and record them (with your mobile) to  mp3, and share the mp3. Like this, one can first read and study a story, and then later listen to it, while biking to work or so. BTW, I don't know whether github allows the sharing of mp3 files.

So, why did I build this? In the first place, I dislike reading grammar books (and as a child, I did not grow up with a grammar book in my cradle, so I don't believe in reading such books when trying to learn the basics of a language.) Second, I find the stories in most  learners books very boring. I find them so boring in fact that I hate to read them twice, let alone multiple times. However, I don't mind reading a simple, nice, story multiple times, just to study the language. Third, memorizing words in a new language becomes, for me at least, much easier when they are used right away in a story; these words acquire meaning in this context. And finally, after having read a story a few times, so that I know what to expect, I like to listen to it while doing something else, like hanging out the wash.
